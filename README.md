# Cross-forming-process transfer enabled graph neural networks for axis accuracy prediction in metal tube bending 

## Project Overview

This repository contains datasets used for the study presented in the paper titled **"Cross-forming-process transfer enabled graph neural networks for axis accuracy prediction in metal tube bending."** 


## Data Information

- **Free-Bending (FB) Bending Dataset**:
    - Process parameters and node data before bending are in the `input/` folder.
    - Node data after bending are stored in the `output/` folder.

- **Rotary Draw Bending (RDB) Dataset**:
    - The data are numbered from 500 to 1400.
    - Only XYZ coordinates in the node data are relevant. Please ignore other features in the node data.
    - Process parameters and node data before bending are in the `input/` folder.
    - Node data after bending are in the `output/` folder.
